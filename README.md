Taking the free Pluralsight [course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/csharp-fundamentals-dev?aid=7010c000002SNseAAG&promo=&utm_source=non_branded&utm_medium=digital_paid_search_google&utm_campaign=EMEA_DE_Dynamic&utm_content=&cq_cmp=1743999025&gclid=Cj0KCQiAsqOMBhDFARIsAFBTN3ex8ybAGKaj_2YahiM3118tx2MHOkUBGDUgPG5Cwok0V4-ew_z51Q8aAkH5EALw_wcB)  on C# language

This course is ideal for advanced programmer with some knowlegde, as it will step forward a lot faster than beginner courses. Along with the course, you will setup the IDE and coding environment, create a C# project on your own, test application code, etc. 

The code I prodcued alongside the course is tracked within this repository. Nothing fancy indeed :).
